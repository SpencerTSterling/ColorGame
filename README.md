# ColorGame

This color game would require players to pick the odd one out in a color palette. 
The player is presented with 4-6 squares, all of which seemingly have the same color, but if they look closely there is one slightly different. 
They choose the odd one out and earn points.

There is a Solo Mode where a player plays until their lives run out or they reach a 100 points, and a Multiplayer mode where turns switch between player 1 and player 2 until someone wins. 

# Basic Game Mechanics
 * The colors of the buttons are randomly generated on each turn.
 * A random button is randomly selected to be the "odd one out", and is slightly off color from the rest
 * Each correct button click rewards 10 points - reach 100 points to win.
